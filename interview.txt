//     A module is a function or set of functions which we can use in our applications.it is similar to library in js.
//     module is used because of its reusability and ability to break code into smaller chunk of pieces.
//     there are three different kinds of module in nodejs---
//       1.)in-built or core module
//       2.)local module
//       3.)third-party module

//.     What is the purpose of the module.exports?

//     It is used to export a given file so that other files are allowed to use it.we can export function,data etc with this.
//     It promotes modular programming which means creating smaller chunk of modules which can be used and are independent of each other.
//     It makes it easy to maintain the code base.

//.    Difference between default export and named export?

//     Form a given file,only one default export is possible.when we export a value by default,we dont have to import it by using the same name.
//     From a given file,there can be multiple named exports.when we export by name,we have to import it by using the same name.named exports should be within curly braces.

//.   How do you import any module in Node.js?
